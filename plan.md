# Plan of Action 

+ Step-1 :
    - Initialize a nodejs porject --done
    - convert it to babel --done
    - set express-handlebar as view element --done 
    - create unique id room --done
    - set the HTML page 

+ step-2
    - Use Socket.io and peer to make connection between two medium
    - get the id of other user and call the other user
    - create a new vid element for the user and telecast their stream 





// NOTE //

    - Access our camera and telecast the video --done
        @desc = To implement the above we need to use the java-script func 

    - import socket.io and create the room --done
        @desc = with HTTP we can make only make req and res between two mediums 
                but with Socket.io we can do req from two mediums as well as res from two mediums
    
    - WEBRTC 
        @desc = helps the web browser or the web application to communicate between each devices 
    
    - Peer.js
        @desc = this helps to implement the WEBRTC in a simple way
